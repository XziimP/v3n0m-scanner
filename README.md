# v3n0m-scanner
Small revision to the original now with less limitation's.
I give all credit to the original creator. I merely just changed some code to enable searching any url for vulnerabilities.
I thought limiting to just .com's was not good incase you want to search a .org for example. Since anyone can purchase a .org url for example does not mean it is legit. How ever I do not encourage the use of this program for illegal purposes.
I take no responsibility for the actions of others who misuse this app.
